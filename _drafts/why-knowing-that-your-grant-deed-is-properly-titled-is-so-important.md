If you missed it, our last message was on a common mistake made by married couples regarding their property’s title: Owning the property as joint tenants, instead of as community property. **You can view that video [here.](https://youtu.be/V6I4urst9Kw)&nbsp;**

Similarly, today’s topic is on another mistake made with startling regularity by homeowners that can cost them substantially: Not having their property correctly titled on their grant deed.&nbsp;

These types of situations are, by and large, specific to living trusts. Let’s say you’ve had a living trust done, and your home has been included in that trust by a grant deed. After the fact, you look to refinance your property.&nbsp;

**More often than not, the finance company will take it out of your living trust to complete the refinance.** And, also more often than not, the company won’t place it back in the trust.

Recently, a client of mine needed a home valuation done on her property. Her living trust had been carried out sometime in the 90s. As it happens, when she went to refinance in 1999, the finance company took the money out, but failed to ever return it.

I went back to her with the information that her home hadn’t been in her trust for a number of years, and she was left in disbelief. More than 20 years had gone by with her property unknowingly outside of her trust; suffice it to say, this was a costly mistake.&nbsp;

**This could have ended in disaster had it not been caught—**in the event that she was deceased, her home likely would have been subject to the court system and thousands of dollars would have been spent fixing that mistake.&nbsp;
