What are Prop 58 and Prop 193 and how do they work? 

**Prop 58 allows a parent to transfer property to their children and maintain their very low Prop 13 basis.** This can happen in a couple of different situations. The parent can transfer their property to their child while they’re alive, or it can be transferred through a trust or through their estate after they pass away. 

**Prop 193 essentially does the same thing, except for grandparent-grandchild transfers.** The only difference is, if the middle-generation child is still alive, this exemption doesn’t work. We actually once had a client learn this only after they tried transferring their property to their child and grandchild—they ended up getting reassessed the portion they intended for the grandchild.

If you’d like to know more about these propositions, we have a link to the Board of Equalization’s website on our website that will answer all of your questions.
