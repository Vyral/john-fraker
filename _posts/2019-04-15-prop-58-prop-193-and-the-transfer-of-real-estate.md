What are Prop 58 and Prop 193 and how do they work?&nbsp;

**Proposition 58 allows a parent to transfer property to their children and maintain their very low Prop 13 basis.** This can happen in a couple of different situations. The parent can transfer their property to their child while they’re alive, or it can be transferred through a trust or through their estate after they pass away.&nbsp; We recently helped a client sell his property to his son, and his son was able to take his parents’ very low Proposition 13 basis – saving them a ton on property taxes\!

**Prop 193 essentially does the same thing, except for grandparent-grandchild transfers.** The only difference is, if the parent of the grand-child is still alive, this exemption doesn’t work. We once had a client learn this the hard way.&nbsp; They came to us after they had transferred their property to their child and grandchild.&nbsp; Unfortunately they ended up getting reassessed on the portion of their home that they transferred to their grandchild, because the grandchild’s parent was still alive.&nbsp;
