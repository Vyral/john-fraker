If you’re a homeowner over age 55 and you’re thinking of selling your home soon, you can benefit greatly from Propositions 60 and 90. Prop 60 allows you to take your Prop 13 tax basis with you if you sell and move to another home within the same county. Prop 90 extends this same benefit to participating counties in the state of California. Keep in mind that not all counties will honor Prop 90, though. As you may recall, a recent ballot initiative was defeated that would’ve allowed you to use it in any county in the state. If you’d like to know which counties honor Pro 90, you can visit my website and find a link to the [Board of Equalization’s website.](https://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/prop60-90_55over.htm){: target="_blank"}
